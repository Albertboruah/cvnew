    <p><em>A member of <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Uchiha_Clan"><strong>Konohagakure's Uchiha</strong> </a>clan</em></p>
    <p>Because he grew up without knowing his parents, Obito's childhood was marked by dreams of being acknowledged. This motivated him to become a ninja so that he could, in turn, become Hokage and have the entire village finally recognise him. When Rin acknowledged him regardless, Obito fell in love with her and aimed to earn her love in addition to the Hokage title. But Kakashi's presence, both in the classroom and later on their team, became a wall for Obito, because of Kakashi's prodigy and that he had, without trying, gained Rin's affections. Though generally kind and of unwavering loyalty to his friends and allies, Obito nevertheless formed a one-sided rivalry with Kakashi. When not in competition with Kakashi, Obito would famously perform random good deeds around Konoha, especially for the elderly, which in turn made him notoriously late.[29] This combination of factors and Obito's naturally just heart and optimism made him easy for Madara to exploit and ultimately corrupt</p>

    <h3>Intelligence</h3>
    <p>rom Madara, Obito learned much about the world, individual people in it, and different abilities from throughout history. As such, it is difficult to surprise him in combat because he already knows tactics ninja from certain villages are likely to use, what weaknesses to take advantage of in different opponents, and how to counter most jutsu.On those infrequent occasions when he encounters something new, he calmly keeps his distance and observes carefully until he devises the best approach to neutralising it. His insight enables him to plan years in advance, accurately predicting the course of nations and knowing just how to manipulate them to his advantage.[91] If any plan of his should fail for whatever reason, he can formulate a backup plan quickly and without being inconvenienced, proving tremendous strategic and tactical ingenuity. Indeed, Obito often kept multiple back-up plans, rarely pinning his hopes on a single outcome. Obito also demonstrates high abilities in manipulation, able to see the darkness in others and twist them to his own purposes with a clever mixture of truth and lies. As Tsunade noted, by taking on the identity of the infamous Madara Uchiha, Obito was able to command the influence that came with it, such as the entire world taking his simple declaration of the Fourth Great Shinobi War seriously.</p>
